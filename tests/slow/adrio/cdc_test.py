# GOALS:
# - integration test with CDC API for basic functionality
# - test and validate all CDC ADRIOs
#   - results are in good range
#   - results are complete in geo axis
#   - all options work as expected
#   - check masks, when masks are expected
#
# Should we test with mock (precaptured) CDC data, so we don't bombard the endpoint?
# Maybe we have a fast battery *and* a slow battery...
