    "Testing our us_census functions for loading canonical sets of IDs for Census granularities from state to block group for all supported TIGER years (2000 and 2009-2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is our source of truth for these delineations, we want to make sure we're getting complete data. One thing we can test is that at each level of granularity (above block group) each node should contain at least one child node. That is every state should contain a county, every county a tract, and every tract a block group. Otherwise we know something is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "(This may seem like a trivial test, but in fact it discovered that my original assumptions about how TIGER provides the data were invalid and has already saved us from bugs!)\n",

    "WARNING: this will take a very long time if you don't have the TIGER files cached."
