    "_Author: Meaghan Freund_\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "LODES (LEHD Origin-Destination Employment Statistics) is a collection of state-organized data files, owned by the U.S. Census Bureau and is a part of the LEHD (Longitudinal Employer-Household Data) program. The datasets are collected through LEHD Census data, which is made through combining previously collected survey and administrative data from participating states on jobs, businesses, and workers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Collection and Updates**\n",
    "\n",
    "LODES data is collected and mapped at the smallest geographic unit that the Census Bureau collects: blocks. This data is collected annually and updated regularly through new versions of LODES. The most recent version, LODES8, spans from 2002-2021 inclusively and maps all blocks with 2020 Census delineations, including blocks that were originally defined in past Census delineations, such as from the 2010 Census.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Geographic Coverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "LODES covers 51 states in the U.S., including defining Washington D.C. as its own state, and territorial partners such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. However, in LODES8, Puerto Rico is the only territorial partner that is covered. Similarly, certain states do not have files in specific years that LODES provides. Some of the reasons can include a lack of availability of data for a state or a location not being in regular production for LODES.\n",
    "The current list of exceptions includes:\n",
    "- *2002*: Arkansas, Arizona, DC, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire\n",
    "- *2003*: Arizona, DC, Massachusetts, Mississippi\n",
    "- *2004-2009*: DC, Massachusetts\n",
    "- *2010*: Massachusetts\n",
    "- *2017-2018*: Alaska\n",
    "- *2019-2021*: Alaska, Arkansas, Mississippi\n",
    "\n",
    "These intersections do lack information concerning other files within LODES, but for the ADRIO maker, these exceptions are omitted from the calls altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the three files available in LODES (RAC, WAC, and OD) the ADRIO maker relies on the Origin-Destination files to map worker flows between residence and workplace locations through matrices. The Origin-Destination files provide the number of individuals who live in a specific home GEOID and commute to a corresponding work GEOID.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Additional Resources**\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information:\n",
    "- Visit the [LEHD Data Page](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/#lodes) on the Census Bureau's website concerning the LODES files.\n",
    "- Refer to the documentation for the most recent version, [LODES8.1](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/lodes/LODES8/LODESTechDoc8.1.pdf)."

    "### **Basic Queries**\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'label' and 'commuters' are two simple yet imperative queries that show the basic functionality of the LODES ADRIO maker. The 'label' query represents the GEOIDs that are involved with the commuter matrices. The input given by the user for the scope, in this case being states, is translated into a list of GEOIDs. The 'commuters' query shows the total number of workers moving from a home GEOID to a work GEOID as a matrix. The matrix is read so that the rows represent the residence GEOID and the columns are the work location GEOID."
